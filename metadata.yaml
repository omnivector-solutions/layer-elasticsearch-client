summary: Elasticsearch client layer

  This layer provides the reactive client layer for elasticsearch.
  NGINX is used to create loadbalancing proxy to elasticsearch, when new
  elasticsearch members are added to the cluster, this charm will re-render the elasticsearch
  lb-proxy config with the current hosts in the cluster and reload NGINX.

  This means you can point your application config at "http://127.0.0.1:9200" and this layer will
  do the rest.
